# Inference Engine
 An inference engine for propositional logic in software based on:
 - The Truth Table (TT) checking
 - Backward Chaining (BC)
 - Forward Chaining (FC) algorithms
 
The inference engine will take as arguments a Horn-form Knowledge Base **KB** and a query **q** which is a proposition symbol and determine whether **q** can be entailed from **KB**.
